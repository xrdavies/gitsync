# gitsync
gitsync is a script tool to keep your remote branches updated with upstream branches. Just run gitsync.sh in your project root directory. We assume there is nothing need to merge, commit, push in your project while running this script.

# usage
cd <project root>
sh <path to gitsync.sh>

# misc
It's very annoy to keep my forks updated with upstream. So take some minutes to write a simple script to keep them updated. Have fun with it.
